# Face Recognition Login and Sign-Up App

This is a Python application that uses the Kivy framework for creating a simple Face Recognition-based login and sign-up system. Users can either log in if they already have an account or sign up by providing their name. The application captures the user's face during sign-up, trains a recognition model, and then allows the user to log in using their face.

This project was made in less than 2 hours. Of course there is room for improvement and fixing some edge cases but it does indeed show that i'm more than capable to handle uncharted subjects when handed
